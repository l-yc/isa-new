The international community at MIT comprises about 10.12% of the undergraduate and 41.95% of the graduate student body. (For specific statistics refer to the International Students Office).

The International Student's Association at MIT works for and with MIT's international students, striving to promote cultural diversity on campus.

Although most of our members are international students, the ISA welcomes and encourages every MIT Student to join.
