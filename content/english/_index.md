      The International Student Association at MIT or ISA for short, was established to bring together the greatly diverse international community at MIT and to support international causes on campus.

      The ISA works to bring elements from our distinct and richly diverse cultural backgrounds to share them with the MIT community at a cultural, academic,and social level.
